# Requirements

## With this application we should be able to:
- Interact with the console in order to type in the answer that matches what we want to see:
    - See a home page with a list of products (first 30 products)
    - Go to 'Next Page' or 'Previous Page'
    - User search option to type in a work to look for and get back a list of products
    - Choose the id of a single product to see the details
    - From a list of categories, choose one and get the list of every product that belongs to that category
    - Filter the list of products that appear

## Nice to have features
- Use JAVA SWING to interact with the user instead of the console
